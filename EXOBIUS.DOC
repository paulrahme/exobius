1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

Welcome to Exobius.

2. STORY LINE
-------------

You are (your name here), a parking valet at "Le Grande Pizzeria", a
restuarant at...well, somewhere near the almost end of the Universe.
You are having a bad day, getting no tips, the dog ate your homework,
etc, etc, etc... until a cool ship approaches. A rich dude gets out
and says "Park it well..." and gives you no tip. Since you are so damn
depressed, you decide to take it on a hyperspace joyride.

3. GETTING STARTED
------------------

Type Exobius.

Some other "getting started" notes: (for either the really advanced or the
really stupid:)

Making a file EXOBIUS.CFG in the directory will prevent you from having
to type in the four frustrating numbers at the beginning. (ie. GameSpeed,
Mouse/Keyboard, Graphics, Detail).
The file simply consists of the 4 numbers, in a row, seperated by spaces.
I have this thing about putting Enter at the end, but you don't need to.


4. PLAYING THE GAME
-------------------

Use the mouse or keyboard to control your ship, with either the left mouse
button or space bar to fire whatever brilliant weapon I decided to give you
for that stage.

Also, on the 8th(?) stage, (the one when you're flying through space towards
the planet), use the right mouse button (or the 5 on the keypad) to shoot
your secondary weapon - shoots up for when they're in the middle of the
screen and they've come outwards.

DURING THE GAME:
Q : quits to dos (or whatever other SLOW operating system you're using).

D : toggles high/low detail. Recommended is low for stage 1 (flying towards
    the mountain), then high thereafter (you'll know it's wrong if you come
    out of the mountain on stage 3 and see no snow falling, but just a white
    rectangle appears at the bottom of the screen, with a blue one on top.
    Also, the planet (stage 8) will have a really bad texture on high detail,
    but it looks a bit better than low.

P : Pauses the game. This writes the string "PAUSED" on the bottom right of
    the screen and waits for a key to be pressed. If you didn't know that,
    you must be an amoeba who doesn't deserve to be playing a game this
    sophisticated and excellent and better than iD's latest. (Hmmmmmm...?)

RESET : For really bad cases. (Or when alt F4 doesn't work).

5. ABOUT THE AUTHOR
-------------------

Is this a book or a game?

OK, just because I love you:
I was born on this planet.
I have a friend names Chris.
He's sitting next to me now.
I'm not married.
I started making this at the end of 1992 (age of 17) and finished about now
(1995). Admit - in 1992 it wouldn't have been so bad, would it now?
I don't have long blond hair.
I am getting bored of writing this.

6. PROBLEMS
-----------

Q : It doesn't work.
A : It does.

Q : It hangs at some stages.
A : Press Enter. Don't ask, just do it. I never sorted that one out.

Q : When I kill the crow (End of stage 8) it blows up all over me insead
    of at the top of the screen where it is.
A : Stage 8 is really popular in this document, isn't it.

Q : Does it work on Hercules graphics?
A : With a CGA simulator, yes.

Q : Does it work on a Pentium?
A : 1+1=3.

Q : Does it work under Windows?
A : Are you sure you want to do this? Are you sure you want to do that?
    Are you sure you meant to move the mouse in that direction? DOES
    ANYTHING WORK UNDER WINDOWS?? Are you sure you want it to run this
    slowly? Are you sure you want to quit? Are you sure you want to get
    rid of the clouds in the sky? All 95 of them? Are you absolutely sure?
    Are you 100% positively sure? Are you? Are you?

Q : Your sky isn't as well digitised as win95's bitmap.
A : Look at the size of the EXE file. Question answered.

Q : Do you have a dog?
A : He died 2 months ago.

Q : What language did you use?
A : Modula 2. Don't ask, just believe. Also, I found out too late that it
    doesn't have a very nice, working screen swapping utility; hence the
    flicker. (Then I went to university...)

Q : Is there going to be a commercial version?
A : Yes - it's called Exobius 2 - Smell on Earth, and is due for release
    on the 10th October 2960. (Maybe before that if Chris gets his page
    swapping working.) Yes - it's in the making, and supports 3D graphics
    engine (1 up on DOOM, but I suppose by then Quake will be extinct).
    Oh, BTW, I'm the guy who squashed Shareware DOOM onto a single stiffy.
    Chris says I must put in a good word for him:
               A GOOD WORD. 
                             (That's registered in his name, BTW.)

Q : There's no music.
A : I had a LOT of trouble putting it in, so I didn't. However, there is
    a MOD file included, "fastlane.mod", which was the origional music
    by ATMOSFEAR. If you have a MODplayer that can play in the background,
    try running the music in the background then running EXOBIUS as a
    foreground application. (I dunno so much about running it under
    Windows in the background, though - I got some WEIRD stuff happening.
    ...But then, again, that can be expected, can't it...)

Q : What's your e-mail address?
A : If it exists, which it probably doesn't any more by the time you're
    reading this, until the end of 1995 and maybe into 1996 it will
    be "prahme@cs.wits.ac.za". (Does Murphy's law count here?)
