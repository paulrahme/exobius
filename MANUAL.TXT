1. THE STORY OF EXOBIUS AND EXOBIUS 2024
----------------------------------------

Welcome to Exobius!

This is a 2024 update of a game originally released in 1995. I wrote this
in an "advanced for the time but long forgotten" language by the name of
Modula-2, and it was built using the JSI TopSpeed IDE and ocmpiler. It was
when I was still self-taught and learning how to code while finishing school
and starting university, and the original game turned out very glitchy,
flickery, buggy, jerky framerate...you get the idea. Part of this was down to
TopSpeed Modula-2 not having any known assembler or low-level support for
graphics apart from its built-in Graph functions, but admittedly a lot of it
was also down to my lack of experience in how to make games.

Fast-forward to late 2021, and while visitng my family, I found an old CD-ROM
in my sister's drawer, which read "PC Backup 1997". To my surprise, not only
did it still read, it included a backup of the entire folder of the Modula-2
IDE and entire source projects, including Exobius! It didn't take long to get
this running in DOSBox, and before I knew it, I had started tinkering with it,
doing some bugfixes and performance improvements, and then the idea struck me:
I can put over 2 decades of experience as a professional games developer to the
test by remastering an old game written in a mostly forgotten language.

This led to several months of development, culminating in the version you see
here. It's far from perfect by any means - it still flickers pretty badly (due
to having to draw over the same screen every time with no vertical sync or
virtual paging or framebuffer), and try as hard as I could, it was impossible
to get the music to play during the actual intro sequence and gameplay as I
had hoped, so music is limited to static slide-show cutscenes in the intro,
endings and pause menu.

But it's a much better looking, sounding and playing game overall. This version
has several enhancements, optimisations and bug fixes. See the "Exobius 2024
Updates" section below for more details.

This version has been optimised to run on a 486/33, which should be:
- 13,500 cycle CPU speed on DOSBox
- Default 486 Core on a MiSTer (as of early 2024)
Please check you are using these speed settings - slower or faster may lead to
the game being unplayably fast or slow, or not working fully at all.

2. STORYLINE
------------

You are (your name here), a parking valet at "Le Grande Pizzeria", a space
restuarant somewhere near the end of the Universe.

You are having a bad day, getting no tips, the dog ate your homework, etc, etc,
etc... until a cool ship approaches. A rich alien gets out, says "Park it
well..." and gives you no tip. Since you have nothing to lose, you decide to
take it on a hyperspace joyride.
